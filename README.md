# Unity Village Simulator

During my Grade 12 CS course, I began to experiment with creating economic models using computer science, a combination of two of my favourite things! As I continued to develop my Unity skills in my grade 12 year, a natural next step was creating a simple economic bartering-system simulation in Unity.

The project was a fun way to both improve my understanding of economic models, common trades in a bartering-based economy, and grow in my programming abilities. Specifically, I found myself making particular use of Object Oriented Programming principles in C++ to develop this project. OOP was particularly useful for duplicating objects and tracking their information as a group, managing object ownership, and creating and destroying objects.
